Movie Theater App

Project Description:

The Movie Theater App is a web application that allows users to view details of different movies available at a theater. Users can see the list of movies on the left side of the page and click on any movie to view its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets on the right side. The app also provides a "Buy Ticket" button to purchase tickets for the selected movie, and it dynamically updates the number of available tickets based on the tickets sold. Additionally, users can delete a movie from the list, and the app will automatically display details of the next movie after deletion.
